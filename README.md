This is a program that will allow a user to enter notecards and quiz
themselves on them. 

it first gives the option to enter a new set or to view the sets that have been saved

when a set gets entered, it is saved in a text file in the notefolder directory

when the user selects the option to view sets that have been saved, this program lists 
the text files saved in the notefolder directory. they can choose a text file to use. 

when a text file is chosen. the user can then view the note cards and quiz themselves. 
the quiz is now very simple. The user can go through the terms in order and choose 
if they want to see the definition of the term. The user is given the option to add 
a card to a study more list. this part of the program is still in progress. 

further things I want to add:
fix the choice making entry for the quiz function
    -this is super weird at the moment, sometime accepts input, sometimes doesnt. 
get the more study list working
randomize order of cards
add a real quiz, multiple choice or something similar, short answer entry
transfer this to python and add a tkinter gui would be cool.
